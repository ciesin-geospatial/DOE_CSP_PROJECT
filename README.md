# DOE CSP Project

## Models

Low-temperature multi-effect distillation (LT-MED)

Multi-effect distillation with thermal vapor compression (MED-TVC)

Multi-effect distillation with absorption heat pumps (MED-ABS)

Vacuum air gap membrane distillation (VAGMD) in continuous and batch operation modes

Reverse osmosis (RO) with multiple passes

Osmotically assisted reverse osmosis (OARO), forward osmosis (FO), and RO-VAGMD, and RO-FO hybridizations. 


## App (GUI)

The best way to install the application is to download the zip archive from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15cv_CJjvoZmL_OHOqiR90T-2qIDxXUmx?usp=sharing) and follow the instrucitions in the archive. The data files are too large for GitHub storage, that is why the complete archive is available on Google Drive, this repository contains the code and some small data files (the code in the Drive achive is updated from here). 

Once you have downloaded the complete archive, you can check out anyu subsequent updates from GitHub
