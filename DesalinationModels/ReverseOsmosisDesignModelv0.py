Reverse Osmosis Design Model- Fixed Load, fixed pump efficiency, fixed salinity 
Notes:
Can later insert flags for fixed load operation and variable load operation. 
If variable load operation, there would need to be some given relationship between 
pump power consumption and flow/pressure provided to RO. Also, if using centrifugal pumps 
(would use this for RO system > ~4000 m3/day), there is a variable pump efficiency profile 
to consider. If using positive displacement pumps (use for smaller RO systems < 4000 m3/day), 
can assume a relatively constant efficiency but different relationships between power and 
flow/pressure. Typically, pressure varies less, while flow rate is more significantly
altered as power shifts.
